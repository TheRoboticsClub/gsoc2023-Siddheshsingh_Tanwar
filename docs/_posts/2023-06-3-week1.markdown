## Introduction:
Welcome to my GSOC weekly blog, where I'll be sharing my progress and experiences during the coding period. In this post, we'll cover the highlights of Week 1, including my exploration of Docker and setting goals for the upcoming weeks. Despite having exams during this time, I managed to make significant strides in understanding Docker and began working on Dockerizing the visual circuit application.

## Week 1: Docker Exploration and Initial Progress
During the first week of the coding period, I faced the additional challenge of ongoing LAB/Practical exams. However, I made the most of my available time and focused on familiarizing myself with Docker and its application in the visual circuit project. My initial objective was to Dockerize the application, simplifying its deployment process.

### Exploring Docker:
To begin, I conducted in-depth research on Docker and its functionalities. I gained a solid understanding of containerization and the benefits it offers in terms of portability and scalability. With this knowledge in hand, I set out to create a Dockerfile for the visual circuit application.

Dockerizing the Visual Circuit Application:
Using my newfound knowledge, I attempted to create a Docker image that consolidated the frontend and backend into a single file. Although I encountered some challenges along the way, such as issues with working application on assigned port, I remain determined to refine the Docker image and ensure its seamless execution.

## Conclusion:
During Week 1 of the coding period, despite the challenge of ongoing exams, I made significant progress in my GSOC project. I delved into Docker, aiming to Dockerize the visual circuit application for simplified deployment. Although I encountered some hurdles, I am determined to refine the Docker image and ensure its smooth execution. Moving forward, my goals for the upcoming week include deepening my understanding of PythonWebId and the Robotics Application Manager, as well as exploring the implementation of applications using RADI. Stay tuned for more updates on my GSOC journey!

## Goals for the Next Week:
Looking ahead to the next week, I have established the following goals to continue progressing in the project:

#### Deep Dive into PythonWebId and Robotics Application Manager:
To further enhance my development skills and contribute effectively to the project, I plan to delve deeper into PythonWebId and the Robotics Application Manager. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of these tools, I aim to unlock their full potential and leverage them in creating impactful applications.

#### Experimenting with RADI Implementation:
In addition to exploring PythonWebId and the Robotics Application Manager, I am excited to experiment with the Robotics Application Development Interface (RADI). By implementing various applications using RADI, I hope to gain practical insights into its capabilities and identify opportunities for optimization and innovation.
