Hello, everyone! Welcome to my Week 6 update on my Google Summer of Code (GSOC) project. It has been a productive week filled with successful advancements in the integration of zip file functionality and code execution within the Robotics Academy Docker Image (RADI). Let's delve into the details of what I have accomplished.

## Zip File Reception and Unzipping:
I'm excited to share that I have completed the task of receiving a zip file from the user through the web interface. When a user uploads a zip file, the system promptly receives it. Subsequently, the zip file is sent to the RoboticsApplicationManager (RAM) for unzipping. This process ensures that user-generated code and data are readily available for further execution.

## Storage of Unzipped Files in RADI:
Upon successful unzipping, the RAM stores the unzipped files in the workspace/code directory of the RADI. This allows for easy access and execution of the code files within the environment. The unzipped files are stored with the name "main.py," reflecting the main code file of the user's uploaded zip file.

## Code Execution and Output Display:
By pressing the play button on the interface, the system initiates the execution of the main.py file within the RADI environment. The output generated by the code is then displayed on the web interface, providing users with a convenient way to observe and analyze the results of their code execution.
