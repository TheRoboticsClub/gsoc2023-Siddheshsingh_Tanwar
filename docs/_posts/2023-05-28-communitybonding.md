## Introduction:
Hello everyone! Welcome to my weekly blog, where I document my journey as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) participant. In this edition, I will discuss how I managed to balance my university exams with the GSoC community bonding period, ensuring that I made the most of both commitments.

## Balancing Academics and GSoC:
As the community bonding period coincided with my end-semester exams at the university, it was undoubtedly a challenging time. However, I was determined to make the most of this crucial phase. While preparing for my exams, I made sure to attend the weekly meetings scheduled by the Mentors and maintain regular communication with my mentors. This helped me stay connected and gain a clear understanding of the project requirements and expectations.

## Conclusion:
The overlap of my university exams with the GSoC community bonding period presented a unique set of challenges. Nevertheless, by actively engaging in weekly meetings, communicating with mentors, implementing effective time management and maintaining focus and motivation, I successfully navigated this demanding period. I am excited about the upcoming coding period and look forward to making significant progress in my project. Stay tuned for the next blog post, where I will share updates on my coding journey as a GSoC participant.
